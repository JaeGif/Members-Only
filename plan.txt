This project is basically a posting app. First visit, you're prompted to login or enter as a guest. If you enter valid creds you can look
at pieces of posts from other users, including their name, and the date of the post. 

Users are authenticated using bcrypt, and if they are a member of the community, 
then they can see the full post body.
